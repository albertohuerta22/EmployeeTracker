## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Bendwell is a wellness platform aimed at those who are stuck at their desks for many hours at a time. Through the use of a custom trained pose detection model, users are able to stretch and recieve real time feedback, without having to leave their office, desk, or any other workspace they are at. Users can choose stretches to try from our pre-trained catalogue of stretches, or if interested, can make an account to build custom routines for targeting certain muscle groups, having a set break for stretching, or to accomate for different space requirments.
